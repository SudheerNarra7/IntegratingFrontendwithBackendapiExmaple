## Installation

Instructions to get the project set up for development. This often requires separate steps for frontend and backend.

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js (specify version, e.g., `>= 18.x`)
* npm or yarn
* Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB - specify version)
* Other dependencies (e.g., Docker)

**Backend Setup:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the backend directory (adjust path as needed)
cd <repository-name>/backend

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Run database migrations and seeding (if applicable)
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

**Frontend Setup:**

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory (adjust path as needed)
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

*Clarity in dependency management instructions is vital. Developers need to know precisely which versions of tools and libraries are required to avoid compatibility issues. Explicitly listing prerequisites prevents guesswork and setup failures.*

## Configuration

Explain how to configure the application, focusing on environment variables or configuration files. This section is critical due to the potential complexity involved in setting up connections between frontend, backend, and databases.

**Backend:**

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory root.
2.  Copy the contents from `.env.example` (if provided) and fill in the necessary values:

    ```dotenv
    # Example backend .env configuration
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
    JWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_jwt_secret_key
    # Add other necessary variables (API keys, external service URLs, etc.)
    ```

*Ensure database setup instructions (user creation, database creation) are included if not handled by migrations.*

**Frontend:**

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory root.
2.  Copy the contents from `.env.example` (if provided) and fill in the necessary values:

    ```dotenv
    # Example frontend .env configuration
    # Note: React apps often require variables to be prefixed (e.g., REACT_APP_)
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api # Or the actual backend server URL
    # Add other frontend-specific variables (analytics keys, feature flags, etc.)
    ```

## Running the Application

Provide commands to start the development servers for both components. This separation reflects the typical development workflow for such architectures.

**Backend:**

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory if not already there
cd path/to/your/backend

# Start the backend development server (often uses nodemon for auto-reloading)
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The backend server will typically be running on `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`). Check the console output for the exact URL.

**Frontend:**

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory if not already there
cd path/to/your/frontend

# Start the frontend development server
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The frontend application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port specified by the framework). Check the console output for the exact URL.

*Clear instructions on how to get the application running locally are paramount for developer productivity and onboarding. Ambiguity here can be a significant roadblock.*

## API Endpoints

This section is crucial for understanding how the frontend and backend communicate. Document the main API endpoints provided by the backend. Using a table is highly recommended for clarity. This documentation acts as a contract between the two parts of the application.

| Method | Path             | Description                   | Request Body (Example)              | Success Response (2xx Example)         | Error Response (4xx/5xx Example)     |
| :----- | :--------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/users`     | Retrieve a list of users      | _N/A_                               | `[{id, name, email}, ...]`           | `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`        |
| `POST` | `/api/users`     | Create a new user             | `{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "..." }` | `{ id, name, email }`                | `{ "error": "Invalid input" }`       |
| `GET`  | `/api/users/{id}`| Get details for a user      | _N/A_                               | `{ id, name, email, profile }`       | `{ "error": "User not found" }`      |
| `PUT`  | `/api/users/{id}`| Update a specific user        | `{ "name": "Jane Doe" }`            | `{ id, name, email, profile }`       | `{ "error": "Update failed" }`       |
| `DELETE`| `/api/users/{id}`| Delete a specific user        | _N/A_                               | `{ "message": "User deleted" }`      | `{ "error": "Deletion failed" }`     |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login`| Authenticate user & get token | `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }` | `{ "token": "jwt.token.string" }`    | `{ "error": "Invalid credentials" }` |
| `GET`  | `/api/items`     | Retrieve a list of items      | _N/A_                               | `[{ id, itemName, price }, ...]`     | `{ "error": "Database error" }`      |
| `POST` | `/api/items`     | Add a new item                | `{ "itemName": "...", "price": ... }` | `{ id, itemName, price }`            | `{ "error": "Validation failed" }`   |

*(Add more endpoints as necessary. Consider linking to more detailed API documentation like Swagger/OpenAPI if the API is complex.)*

*Detailed API documentation within the README (or linked from it) is indispensable for frontend developers consuming the API and for anyone needing to understand the system's interface.*

## Usage

Explain how to use the application after it's running. Provide examples or describe key features. Screenshots or GIFs can be very effective here.

1.  Navigate to the frontend application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser.
2.  Register a new account or log in using existing credentials (if authentication is implemented).
3.  Describe core workflows (e.g., "How to create a new post," "Managing user settings," "Viewing the dashboard").

## Testing

Provide instructions on how to run automated tests. Specify if any specific setup is needed for the test environment (e.g., a separate test database, environment variables).

**Backend Tests:**

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd path/to/your/backend

# Run unit/integration tests (adjust command based on test runner used)
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

**Frontend Tests:**

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd path/to/your/frontend

# Run component/end-to-end tests (adjust command based on test runner used)
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

## Deployment

Provide notes or instructions on how to deploy the application to staging or production environments. Mention platform-specific steps if applicable (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Vercel, Docker). Include steps for creating production builds.

**Frontend Build:**

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd path/to/your/frontend

# Create a production-optimized build
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
*(The output is usually in a `build` or `dist` folder).*

**Backend Build (if applicable, e.g., for compiled languages like TypeScript):**

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd path/to/your/backend

# Compile code for production
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
*(The output is usually in a `dist` or `build` folder).*
